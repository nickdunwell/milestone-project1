## Design

## Colour Scheme

I wanted the look of the site to be plain and straighhtforward and, as such, have only gone with 2 colours (green and blue), with a lighter version for highlighting.

In my CSS file, I have used variables to declare colours, and then used these throughout the css file.

  * I have used '#313977' and '#2eb239' as the primary and secondary colours used for background and text colours.
  * I have used '#416a8e' and '#7a9fc2' as highlight colours for buttons.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts that I have used on the site.

* For headers, I have used the Google Font [Macondo] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Macondo?query=macondo)
* For all other text, I have used the Google Font [Inter] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter)

### Imagery

As the website is for a gym, I have used images of a bright, clean, inviting area that looks welcoming to clients.

All images have come from [Google Images](https://images.google.co.uk/)

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for this website using Balsamiq

![Booking and Success Page]("C:\Users\Nick\Documents\milestone-project1\assets\images\Booking Page.png")

### Features

The website mainly comprises of a main page, where the majority of functions can be accessed. There is an additional Booking and Success page.

All pages and buttons on the website are responsive and have:

* A Favicon in the browser tab.
   ![Favicon] ("C:\Users\Nick\Documents\milestone-project1\assets\images\Browser Tab.jpg")

* A header bar with responsive buttons for the main sections:
  ![Header] ("C:\Users\Nick\Documents\milestone-project1\assets\images\Header.jpg")

  #### The Home Page

  The home page of the BUFF GYM website displays the sites name as well as a container which holds some welcome text as well as a booking button. There is also a carousel, which scrolls through images of the gym.

  ![Home page image] ("C:\Users\Nick\Documents\milestone-project1\assets\images\home page.jpg")
  
  Next on the page is information about the classes held at the gym, along with images and cost of these classess.s

  ![Classes] ("C:\Users\Nick\Documents\milestone-project1\assets\images\classes.jpg")

  the next section is Meet the Team, with images of team members and the classes they run.

  ![Meet the Team] ("C:\Users\Nick\Documents\milestone-project1\assets\images\Meet.jpg")

  In the footer, there is contact details, including address, email, phone number and opening times.

  ![Contact] ("C:\Users\Nick\Documents\milestone-project1\assets\images\contact.jpg")

  ### The Booking Page

  The booking page includes a form to fill in with the intention of joining a class. After the submit button is pressed, there is an additional Success page, notifying the user that their form has successfully been submitted, and gives the option to go back to the Home page.

  ![Booking Page] (https://bqspj775-8000.uks1.devtunnels.ms/booking.html)

  The success page appears after you have successfully completed the booking form. The for is set up that you need to complete the appropriate criteria (a number in the phone number box, email address in the email box, etc.), so that the user gets instant feedback as to whether the form has been filled in and sent correctly.

  ## Testing

  To primarily test my website, I used Lighthouse in Devtools

  I used W3C Markup Validator for HTML and CSS validation - [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

  
  ### Solved Bugs

  There were a couple of issues with W3C Validator, but seem to be mainly unclosed code, which was rectified.
