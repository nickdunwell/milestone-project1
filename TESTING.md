Testing was ongoing throughout the build. I utilised Chrome developer tools whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

During development I made use of google developer tools to ensure everything was working correctly and to assist with troubleshooting when things were not working as expected.

I utilised the console in the developer tools to work through small sections of JavaScript and ensure that the code was working, and also to troubleshoot where issues were.

I have gone through each page using google chrome developer tools & Firefox inspector tool to ensure that each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate the CSS.

* index.html - [index.html](. When I tried to take it out, the imagery was wrong, so hav eleft them in.
* booking.html - Passed, no errors
* success.html - Passed, no errors.

* style.css - Passed, no errors found.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

### Desktop Results

![lighthouse results](https://github.com/nickdunwell/milestone-project1/blob/main/lighthouse-results.jpg) 
The main performance issues are with image sizing and external font retrieval.
The SEO issues are just because the website has not been deployed amd searchable yet.

### Mobile Results

![index.html](https://github.com/nickdunwell/milestone-project1/blob/main/lighthouse-results-mobile.jpg)
The performance results are, again, because of image sizing and external retrieval.
The SEO issues are the same as desktop.
